# OpenCode: Comprehensive Key Concepts (Validated Version)

## 1. What is OpenCode?

### Definition
OpenCode refers to multiple concepts and platforms that embrace open source principles:
1. **OpenCode Interview Platform** - Real-time collaborative coding interview platform (open source alternative to CoderPad/HackerRank)
2. **OpenCode Project Marketplace** - Platform for sharing free and paid software projects
3. **OpenCode AI Configuration** - Configuration system for AI model integration
4. **General Open Source Development** - The broader methodology of open source software development

### Core Concepts
- **Open Source Philosophy**: Source code is made freely available for modification, distribution, and improvement
- **Collaborative Development**: Multiple contributors work together on projects
- **Transparency**: All development processes and decisions are visible to the community
- **Meritocracy**: Contributions are valued based on quality and impact, not hierarchy

### Historical Context
- **OpenCode Interview Platform**: Created in 2024-2025 as an open source alternative to commercial coding interview platforms
- **Built upon**: Modern web technologies (Firebase, ACE Editor, Piston API)
